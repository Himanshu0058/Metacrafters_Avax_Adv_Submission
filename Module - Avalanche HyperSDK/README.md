## HyperChain Feature

Here’s a more detailed and comprehensive description of your **Hyperchain Features**:

### Hyperchain Features:

1. **Asset Management**:  
   Hyperchain provides a robust and comprehensive asset management system that empowers users and developers to easily handle the full lifecycle of digital assets. This feature includes:

   - **Creation**: Users can effortlessly create new digital assets or tokens that represent anything of value, such as financial instruments, governance tokens, or other tokenized representations of physical or digital assets. These assets can be configured with various properties like supply, divisibility, and ownership rights.
   
   - **Minting**: Once an asset is created, the system allows for the minting of additional tokens as needed. This feature is crucial for dynamic ecosystems where the supply of tokens may need to expand over time to accommodate increased demand, incentivize users, or implement governance decisions.

   - **Burning**: Hyperchain’s asset management also includes the ability to burn tokens, reducing the supply in circulation. This is essential for managing deflationary mechanics, controlling inflation, or retiring outdated assets, providing ultimate flexibility and control over the token economy.

   - **Swapping**: Hyperchain integrates seamless token swapping functionality, enabling users to exchange one asset for another with minimal friction. Whether used for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, liquidity pools, or cross-chain transactions, the swapping feature ensures fast, secure, and efficient asset exchanges.

   This comprehensive asset management suite allows developers and users to exercise fine-tuned control over their tokens, enabling complex financial ecosystems, DeFi applications, and custom blockchain projects.

2. **Orderbook System**:  
   Hyperchain offers an advanced **Orderbook System** designed to handle various types of trades and transactions with a focus on transparency, speed, and efficiency. The orderbook system introduces a methodical and structured approach to managing orders across the network, allowing users to interact seamlessly with decentralized markets. It includes:

   - **Order Creation**: Users and smart contracts can define detailed buy or sell orders for assets. The order creation process allows for specifying key parameters such as price, quantity, and duration. This feature ensures that users have precise control over how their orders are placed on the network, enabling both market and limit orders.

   - **Order Filling**: The system handles order matching in a way that maximizes efficiency. When a counterparty’s order aligns with the specifications of an existing order, the platform automatically fills the order at the specified conditions. The speed of order filling is enhanced through Hyperchain’s high-performance infrastructure, ensuring low-latency transactions for users and applications.

   - **Order Closing**: Once an order is either fully filled or manually closed, the system updates the orderbook in real-time. Any remaining unfilled portions of an order can either expire according to user-defined parameters or be canceled by the user. This feature ensures that users can maintain control over open orders and easily withdraw or cancel orders when needed.

   The orderbook approach implemented in Hyperchain provides a transparent and user-friendly mechanism for handling trade orders. It is particularly well-suited for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), financial markets, or any system where the precise control of trading assets is critical. By integrating these features, Hyperchain creates a powerful ecosystem for asset trading that is both efficient and highly customizable.

### Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get started with your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/Himanshu0058/Metacrafters_Avax_Adv_Submission
   cd Metacrafters_Avax_Adv_Submission/Module - Avalanche HyperSDK
   ```

2. **Run the Network**  
   Once you've cloned the repository, you can initialize the network by executing the following script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh
   ```

   By default, this script allocates all the funds on the network to the following address:
   ```
   token1rvzhmceq997zntgvravfagsks6w0ryud3rylh4cdvayry0dl97nsjzf3yp
   ```
   The corresponding private key for this address is:
   ```
   0x323b1d8f4eed5f0da9da93071b034f2dce9d2d22692c172f3cb252a64ddfafd01b057de320297c29ad0c1f589ea216869cf1938d88c9fbd70d6748323dbf2fa7
   ```
   For convenience, this private key is stored in a file called `demo.pk`.

   If you only need a single subnet for testing, you can run:
   ```bash
   MODE="run-single" ./scripts/run.sh
   ```

3. **Build the Token CLI**  
   To interact with the TokenVM, you’ll need to build the token-cli. Navigate to the script directory and run the following command to compile the CLI:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

   After building, the compiled CLI will be located at:
   ```
   ./build/token-cli
   ```

4. **Import Key and Chain Information**  
   Now, you'll need to import the default private key and the chains created by the network. Use the following commands:
   
   - Import the private key:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli key import demo.pk
     ```

   - Import chain information:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli chain import-anr
     ```

   The `chain import-anr` command connects to the Avalanche Network Runner (ANR) server running in the background and retrieves the URIs for all the nodes tracking the chains you created.
